                    <b> What is my point?</b> <br />
                    In this article I want to tell you what I personaly do to work like a senior developer while I don't have +10 years of experience.
                    In order to achieve that, you should follow these steps:<br />
                    <br />
                    <b>1. Learn coding like a senior not a jonior</b><br />
                    <br />
                    What junior developers do to learn coding like learning a language let's say Javascript is that they just find some 4 to 10 hour courses online or attend some classes and that's totaly fine to get started but to be like seniors it's not enough.<br />
                    What senior developers do is that they read all the documents and believe me when you read the documents you really master that subject.<br />
                    Now you say that these documents are so long and even if we read all of them we can't memorize this amount of information and that's 100 percent true, seniors are not memorizing all that in once either. they constantly checking the document and memorized most of that in years of work and experience.<br />
                    What I do to memorize such a big data in a short amount of time instead of years of experience is that I don't memorize all that. Here is my way of learning:<br />
                    <b>A.</b> Use a not so long video tutorial about that subject to get the idea of that technology<br />
                    <b>B.</b> Read all the document and practice to know all the features of that technology<br />
                    <b>C.</b> While I'm reading I create my own short document I call it digital notes<br />
                    You can findout what it is by checking my javascript source repository in my github<br />
                    <b>D.</b> Now while I'm coding if I need a feature I know whether it exist or not  but I don't remember so I get back to my digital notes or the document itself.<br />
                    With this trick instead of store all those data in my brain in short time which is almost impossible I'm using the computer and my digital notes as my brain. By passing of time I will memorize the features I mostly use in my projects.<br />
                    <br />
                    <b>2. Code like a pro and learn from senior developers experience</b><br />
                    <br />
                    Guys and girls, a big difference between senior and junior programmers is that seniors not just write a code that only works which almost every junior do.<br />
                    But everybody can write a code that works and there is multiple ways to write a logic. We should write a clean code which others understand also our algorithms must be optimized in order to have a high performance application.<br />
                    So what we can do is:<br />
                    <b>A.</b> Ask and watch senior developers videos and articles on the internet to learn from their experience. See how they write an algorithm to know their point of view.<br />
                    <b>B.</b> Study algorithm design books and tutorials to learn how you create a high performance algorithm<br />
                    <b>C.</b> Learn principles of clean code<br />
                    <b>D.</b> If you want to code a logic there is a high chance that someone (maybe a senior) wrote an optimized code for that logic. Just use that instead of spending a big amount of time writing a bad code.<br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Last words</b><br />
                    <br />
                    Whatever you do, becoming a senior developer takes time. Like mastering anything else.<br />
                    But I'm trying to make this time shorter which you can do it too.<br /><br />

            return (
                <p>

                    <b>What is my point?</b><br />
                    Tech, computers and programming is a big world which is updating every second.<br />
                    Try to be updated is a hard thing to do but in this article I want to discuss how I stay up to date as a programmer.<br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Don't learn useless tech and content</b><br />
                    <br />
                    There is a lot to learn in tech. Hundreds of languages, frameworks, libraries etc. If you start learning all of them you must spend the next 50 years of your life and even if you remember all of that ( which is imposible ) all those knowledge will be outdated and useless by then.<br />
                    What you should do is that pick a niche in programming like web development, mobile developmen, android, ios, frontend, backend etc. For example if you pick web development your language will be javascript so do not waste your time learning other languages and just master javascript now it's easier to be master and up to date in one language.<br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Learn and master fundamentalls really good</b><br />
                    <br />
                    All techs come and go but fundametalls stay. What I'm going to say is master fundamentals then you have less time try to be updated in new techs.<br />
                    First master fundamentals of programming which is almost the same in most languages like data types, loops, functions, classes etc. And master writing algorithms and problem solving by practicing a lot.<br />
                    Then find out main techs in your programming niche like web development which is HTML, CSS and Javascript, so learn and master them then it's easier to be up to date with frameworks and libraries which are changing a lot.<br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Learn while you are coding projects</b><br />
                    <br />
                    You don't have to know everything to start working on your project if you stuck in a problem just go research how you can fix it. Learn it and implement it to your project.<br />
                    <br />
                    We can not learn everything but we can learn what we need while we're working on our project.<br /><br />

                <p>

                    <b>What is my point?</b><br />
                    In this article I'm trying to tell you what I think we should do to create value for our company that we are working in and how we can really help them grow.<br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Do not work somewhere you don't like</b><br />
                    <br />
                    The most important thing to do when applying for jobs is that first make sure you know and like that company because if you don't, you don't feel good working there also that company is not getting much value from you because you don't care about they're goals.<br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Do not just code, engineer for them</b><br />
                    <br />
                    What I mean is that don't just code some apps that only works but engineer those apps to have a high performance so the clients be happy if the client be happy the company get more clients, they get richer and you get benefits to work as a rich company employer.<br />
                    Write clean code so every body in the team can understand what you did and use your problem solving skills to give ideas in order to fix their problems.<br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Comunicate and be friend with the team</b><br />
                    <br />
                    One of the key reasons for a company to succeed is that they're employers have a good friendship together becauae if they are having a good time together they will enjoy working in that company that can lead to a great work.<br /><br />
